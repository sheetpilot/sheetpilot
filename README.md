## Project goals

We want SheetPilot to fit in your existing project instead of forcing you to use SheetOps for every aspect of it.

Of course SheetPilot is (or will be) great as an all-in-one tool, but we know how development works: having an existing codebase shouldn't lock you out of using SheetPilot.
And using SheetPilot shouldn't lock you out of using other technologies. In fact, SheetPilot's main goal is to make it easy to glue together ..... technologies.

We do this by:
